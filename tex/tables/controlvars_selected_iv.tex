\caption{Control variables selected via the post-double-selection procedure of \textcite{bch2014a} in all LATE models. In the \textit{All Observations} model, \textit{Midterm 1 score} and \textit{Year = 2019} are additionally included as controls. In the \textit{Fixed Effects} model, pair fixed effects are included. All control variables are measured before the start of the experiment, e.g. \textit{Hours videos} is the hours of videos watched as of the first midterm.} \label{controlvars_selected_iv}\\
