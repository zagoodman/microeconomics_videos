\Fignote{This table reports coefficients on $Incentive_i$ from Equations \ref{itt_spec}. There were seven \textit{Attendance checks} during the quarter. \textit{Tutoring visits} includes those after the first midterm. Model (1) contains linear controls for midterm 1 score and year; (2) is the difference in means and standard errors calculated using the repeated sampling framework of Neyman (1923); (3) and (4) use the post-double-selection (PDS) procedure of \textcite{bch2014a} to select control variables then estimate treatment effects and standard errors. The control variables selected using PDS are listed in Table \ref{controlvars_selected_itt}. Models (2) and (4) include only students whose matched-pair did not attrite from the experiment. \textit{Control Mean} is the mean for the Control students included in models (1) and (3), which is nearly identical to the mean for the Control students included in models (2) and (4). \Regnote}
